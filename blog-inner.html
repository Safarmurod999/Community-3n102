                <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about how to
                    get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma
                    plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX
                    copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to
                    playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing
                    voice and tone for error messages.</p>

                    Step 4: Select the type of error you are looking for. You will get three different copies for each 
                    error <br>
